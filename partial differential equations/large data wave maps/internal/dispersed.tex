Energy dispersion
	\[ \sfED [\phi] = \sup_{N \in 2^\Z} ||P_N \phi||_{L^\infty_{t, x} [I]} \]
Scaling dictates that 
	\[ ||P_N \phi||_{L^\infty_x} \lesssim ||\phi||_{\dot H^1_x} \]	
So while we do not have the endpoint embedding $\dot H^1 \subseteq L^\infty$, we do have this embedding into the energy dispersion space, which is essentially the Besov-type space $L^\infty_t (B^{0, \infty}_\infty)_x$. 	

\begin{theorem}[Energy-dispersed regularity theorem]
	Let $\phi$ be a solution to the wave maps equation \eqref{wave} with finite energy $\cE[\phi] \leq \cE$, then there exists $F(\cE) \gg 1$ and $\epsilon (\cE) \ll 1$ such that 
		\[ \sfED[\phi] \leq \epsilon (\cE), \]
	then 
		\[ ||\phi||_{\cS [I]} \leq F(\cE).  \]
	Furthermore, considering an admissible frequency envelope $c$ attached to some $\vec \phi$, we obtain 
		\[ ||P_N \phi||_{\cS [I]} \lesssim c_N \]
	such a solution extends to a neighborhood of the interval $I$.

Extends and complements the threshold theorem. Establishing dichotomy between bubbling and regularity.

\begin{proposition}
	There exists a constant $\epsilon_0 > 0$ such that for every sequence $\{\phi_n\}_n$ of solutions to the defocusing \eqref{NLW} on $(-2, 2) \times 4B$ with uniformly small energy
		\begin{align}
			\cE_{\{0\} \times 4B} [\phi_n] 
				&\ll \epsilon_0^2, 
		\end{align}
	and is asymptotically stationary, 
		\begin{align}
			\iint_{(-2, 2) \times 4B} |(Y + b) \phi_n|^2 \, dx \overset{n \to \infty}{\longrightarrow} 0,
		\end{align}
	for some uniformly time-like vector field $Y$ and a smooth function $b$, then, after passing to a subsequence, we can extract a solution $\Phi \in H^{3/2}_{t, x} ((-1, 1) \times B)$ to the defocusing \eqref{NLW} to which the sequence converges strongly in $H^1 ((-1, 1) \times B)$ and 
		\begin{equation}
			(Y + b) \Phi = 0. 
		\end{equation}
		
\end{proposition}

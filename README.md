# notes

These are expository notes which are within $\varepsilon \ll 1$ of being fully polished, at least to the extent that I think they would be marginally more helpful to others than what is already readily available on the Internet. Most of these notes originated from preparation for my PhD qualifying exam. 

If there are any errors or typos, feel free to shoot me an email!
